These are only the mods that I downloaded but unedited who would be interested in the whole setup and edited all the mods (.css) that I made thanks to AI in Cursor which I recommend if you want to edit .css yourself. I can send all the files to chat or somewhere and you just copy them to your chrome folder.

Coheison and Natsumi - https://github.com/TheBigWazz/ZenThemes (url animation and toolbar look)

Tabgroups - https://github.com/Anoms12/Advanced-Tab-Groups/blob/main/README.md (new look)

My-internet - https://github.com/sameerasw/my-internet (pop up animation etc. and blur background)

Mods and folder Chrome:
